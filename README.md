## Introduction
The new thing about this project is that we get to learn something called **raycasting**, which is a method of graphical programming to render 3D environments to a 2D screen. However, this method has its own pros and cons which includes:
- This method of rendering is lightweight and used by very old games where the machine has weak processing power
- This method is relatively easy to implement from scratch compared to its alternative [**raytracing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing)

However, 
- This method assumes that all borders of the map are closed
- This method assumes that the map has constant height

The basic idea of raycasting is as follows: the map is a 2D square grid, and each square can either be 0 (= no wall), or 1 (= wall)

![Sample map](https://github.com/neosizzle/cub3d/blob/main/pictures/sample-map.png)

You then imagine your screen as a coordinate plane, and it seperated into columns (x - axis) like so :

![monitor](https://github.com/neosizzle/cub3d/blob/main/pictures/monitor.png)

For every x of the screen (i.e. for every vertical stripe of the screen), send out a ray that starts at the player location and with a direction that depends on both the player's looking direction, and the x-coordinate of the screen. Then, let this ray move forward on the 2D map, until it hits a map square that is a wall. If it hit a wall, calculate the distance of this hit point to the player, and use this distance to calculate how high this wall has to be drawn on the screen: the further away the wall, the smaller it's on screen, and the closer, the higher it appears to be. These are all 2D calculations.

The end result will look something like this :

... and thats pretty much the basic idea of raycasting. I will be talking about map parsing and validation next, so if you want to skip to the raycasting implementation, click [here](#player-direction-vector-and-camera-vector)

## Map parsing and validating
A valid map / config file obeys the following rules:
- The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the playerâ€™s start position and spawning
orientation.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls
- Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or more empty line(s).
- Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
- Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
by one or more space(s).
- The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map,
as long as it respects the rules of the map.

These are examples of valid map files.

![valid_map2](https://github.com/neosizzle/cub3d/blob/main/pictures/valid_map2.png)

I wont talk much about the texture and valiadtion colors here. 
Unlike so_long, the rules of the map are laxed and allowing more creative freedom. The map will may not be rectangular in shape and may have many weird edges/curves and corners. However, the map can still be parsed as a 2d
character array and treated like normal strings with different lengths each row.

As such, I came up with a few map validation rules. Assume that we are scanning the map from top to bottom, left to right :

- Ignore all leading whitespaces.
- If the current row is the 0th row or the final row, only accept '1's and ' 's.
- -  else, The first character should always be a '1'.
- In the case of any non leading whitespaces, the only acceptable characters adjacent to the space are '1's or ' 's.
- If strlen(curr_row) > strlen(row_on_top) && current col > strlen(row_on_top), current character should be '1'
- If strlen(curr_row) > strlen(row_on_bottom) && current col > strlen(row_on_bottom), current character should be '1'

Those rules should pass all the map requirements given.
